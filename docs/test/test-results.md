#### 3. Approval Boundary Tests (6 tests) 🎯
**Core MVP hypothesis validation** - Testing the approval boundary finality.

| Test | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `test_approve_version` | ✅ Pass | Versions can be approved |
| `test_reject_version` | ✅ Pass | Versions can be rejected with structured feedback |
| `test_finality_prevents_duplicate_approval` | ✅ Pass | **CORE**: Cannot approve a version twice |
| `test_finality_prevents_approval_after_rejection` | ✅ Pass | **CORE**: Cannot approve after rejection |
| `test_finality_prevents_rejection_after_approval` | ✅ Pass | **CORE**: Cannot reject after approval |

#### 4. Integration Tests (2 tests)
End-to-end workflow tests simulating real-world usage.

| Test | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `test_complete_approval_workflow` | ✅ Pass | Full workflow: submit → approve → verify finality |
| `test_complete_rejection_workflow` | ✅ Pass | Full workflow: submit → reject → verify finality |

## Core MVP Validation ✅

The following **critical MVP requirements** have been validated:

### 1. ✅ Decisions Are Binary
- Versions can only be **approved** or **rejected** (no other states)
- Status is clearly returned: `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, or `REJECTED`

### 2. ✅ Decisions Are Explicit
- Both approval and rejection require the `decided_by` field
- No implicit or inferred approvals are possible
- Returns `400 Bad Request` if `decided_by` is missing

### 3. ✅ Finality Is Enforced
- Once a decision is made, it **cannot be changed**
- Attempting to approve an already-decided version returns `409 Conflict`
- Attempting to reject an already-decided version returns `409 Conflict`
- Works in both directions: approve→reject and reject→approve are both blocked

### 4. ✅ Decisions Are Immutable
- Decisions are recorded with timestamps (`decided_at`)
- Who made the decision is always recorded (`decided_by`)
- Retrieval always shows the original decision

### 5. ✅ Versions Are Immutable
- Artifact versions use unique constraints (artifact + version_number)
- Once submitted, versions cannot be duplicated
- URLs are submitted as links (MVP uses URL field only)

## What Can Be Tested Right Now

Based on the current implementation, you can test:

### ✅ Currently Testable
- Creating projects, artifacts, and artifact versions
- Submitting versions via URL for approval
- Approving versions with `decided_by`
- Rejecting versions with `decided_by`, `reason`, and `note`
- Verifying finality enforcement (HTTP 409 Conflict)
- Retrieving version status and decision history
- API error handling (404, 400, 409)
- Complete approval/rejection workflows

### ❌ Not Yet Testable (Deferred Features)
- Multi-tenant organization isolation
- Role-based access control / permissions
- User authentication flows
- File upload functionality
- Real-time notifications
- Email-based invitations
- Public share links

---

## Next Steps for Testing

### Recommended Additional Tests

1. **Performance Tests**
   - Test with large numbers of versions
   - Concurrent approval attempts
   - Database query optimization

2. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Empty/invalid URLs
   - Very long reason/note text
   - Special characters in fields
   - Null/empty `decided_by` variations

3. **API Contract Tests**
   - JSON schema validation
   - Response format consistency
   - HTTP status code compliance

4. **Database Constraint Tests**
   - Test `OneToOneField` constraint directly
   - Test cascade deletion behavior
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios

## Test Maintenance

**Location:** `backend/artifacts/tests.py`

To run tests:
```bash
# All tests
python manage.py test

# Just artifacts app tests
python manage.py test artifacts

# With verbose output
python manage.py test artifacts -v 2

# Specific test class
python manage.py test artifacts.tests.ApprovalBoundaryAPITest

# Specific test method
python manage.py test artifacts.tests.ApprovalBoundaryAPITest.test_finality_prevents_duplicate_approval
```

To run with coverage (requires `coverage` package):
```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test artifacts
coverage report
coverage html  # Creates htmlcov/index.html
```

## Conclusion

✅ **All 23 tests pass successfully**

The test suite validates that the **approval boundary MVP is working as designed**:
- Decisions are binary, explicit, and final
- The API correctly enforces the finality constraint
- HTTP status codes accurately reflect business rules
- Complete workflows function end-to-end

The core hypothesis—that **enforcing finality eliminates ambiguity**—is now testable and validated through automated tests.
